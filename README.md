## 🎓 Day 1 Complete — Let's Review Everything

### 🔖 What You Mastered Today

**Pattern: Two Pointers**
- **Opposite direction** (palindrome) — Start at ends, move inward
- **Converging with condition** (two sum) — Move based on comparison to target
- **Greedy optimization** (max water) — Move pointer that limits potential

**Key insights:**
1. Two pointers turns O(n²) → O(n) when array is sorted or has structure
2. The condition for moving pointers is everything — think carefully about *why* you move each one
3. Sorted arrays unlock powerful greedy decisions

**Complexity analysis:**
- You now understand why single-pass = O(n) even with while loops
- You can articulate time/space tradeoffs
